### **Azure DevOps Organization Structure**  

Azure DevOps is structured hierarchically to manage and collaborate on projects efficiently. Here’s how the organization is structured:  

### **1. Azure DevOps Organization (Top-Level)**
   - The **Azure DevOps Organization** is the top-level container for all projects and resources.  
   - It represents a company, business unit, or development team.  
   - Example: `mycompanydevops`  

### **2. Projects (Inside Organization)**
   - A **Project** is a collection of repositories, pipelines, artifacts, and boards.  
   - Each project has its own settings, security policies, and visibility options.  
   - Example: `WebAppProject`, `APIProject`  

### **3. Teams (Inside Projects)**
   - A **Team** is a sub-group within a project that works on specific tasks.  
   - Each team can have its own backlog, sprint, and board configurations.  
   - Example: `Frontend Team`, `Backend Team`  

### **4. Services in Azure DevOps Projects**
Each project consists of five main services:  
   - **Azure Boards** → Work item tracking, Scrum/Kanban boards.  
   - **Azure Repos** → Git repositories for version control.  
   - **Azure Pipelines** → CI/CD automation for building, testing, and deploying.  
   - **Azure Test Plans** → Manual and automated testing.  
   - **Azure Artifacts** → Package management for NuGet, npm, Maven, etc.  

### **5. Security & Access Control**
   - **Users & Groups** → Assigned to projects or teams with roles (Admin, Contributor, Reader).  
   - **Policies** → Set at the organization, project, or repository level.  
   - **Permissions** → Managed via **Azure DevOps Access Control (ACLs)**.
